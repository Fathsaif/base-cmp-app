# Base Compose Multiplatform (CMP) App

This is a **base project template** for quickly starting new apps using **Jetpack Compose Multiplatform (CMP)**. Itâ€™s especially useful for migrating from native Android/iOS to CMP.

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Included

### âœ… Networking Layer
- Uses [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) for API calls
- Configured with basic request/response handling
- Ready to connect with backend out of the box
- Inspired by the implementation in the **Cashi** app

### âœ… Repository Layer (Data Layer)
- Clean abstraction between data sources and business logic
- Each feature can have its own repository
- Ideal for scalable architecture

### âœ… Business Layer (Use Cases)
- Contains example use cases:
  - `SubmitTransactionUseCase`
  - `GetTransactionsUseCase`
- Encourages clean separation of concerns

### âœ… UI Layer
- Built with **Jetpack Compose Multiplatform**
